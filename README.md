# Naima Gutknecht's Data Science Portfolio 

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing my expertise in data science. Some projects were executed as part of my Certificate of Advanced Studies or as self-learning exercises. It will be regularly updated.

## Introduction

I am a multiskilled and passionate data scientist with a background in human sciences and specialization in the analysis of heritage materials. I have extensive experience in academic research with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary projects. I transferred my skillset from qualitative to quantitative data with the completion of a Certificate of Advanced Studies in Applied Data Sciences at the University of Bern in 2023.

I'm enthusiastic about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems and extract meaningful insights. My goal is to dedicate my career to developing my ability to work with data in a solution-oriented mindset, using data-driven decision-making approaches to tackle real-world challenges.
